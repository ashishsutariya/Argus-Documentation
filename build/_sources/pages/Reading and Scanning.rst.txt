Assisted Reading and Scanning: Illuminating Key Information in ARGUS
---------------------------------------------------------------------

ARGUS recognizes the limitations of solely relying on keyword-based search results. While document retrieval helps identify relevant articles, researchers still need efficient tools to navigate within those articles and locate the specific information they require. To address this challenge, ARGUS offers functionalities for assisted reading and scanning, designed to streamline the information extraction process.

Functionalities for Assisted Reading
-------------------------------------

**User-Friendly Interface:** ARGUS presents the retrieved research article within a dedicated reading pane. This pane allows researchers to comfortably scroll through the article's text and visually identify relevant sections.

**Advanced Search Options:** Beyond the initial document retrieval, ARGUS provides functionalities for refining the search within the chosen article. Researchers can utilize the "find in page" functionality or regular expressions to locate specific terms or phrases within the text. This targeted search within the article streamlines the process of finding relevant sections.

Keyword Highlighting
---------------------

A core feature of ARGUS's assisted reading functionality is keyword highlighting. This feature plays a crucial role in assisting researchers in quickly grasping the content and pinpointing relevant information within the article.

**User-Defined Highlighting:** Users can select specific keywords from their initial search query or define new keywords while reading the article.

**Color-Coded Highlighting:** Once selected, ARGUS highlights all occurrences of those keywords throughout the article text. Each keyword can be assigned a distinct color, allowing for easy visual differentiation.

Benefits of Keyword Highlighting
---------------------------------

**Rapid Identification of Relevant Sections:** Highlighted keywords instantly draw the reader's attention to sections likely to contain pertinent information. This significantly reduces time spent manually scanning through vast amounts of text.

**Improved Contextual Understanding:** By highlighting multiple keywords within a sentence or paragraph, ARGUS allows researchers to grasp the context in which those keywords are used. This deeper understanding facilitates a more nuanced interpretation of the research findings presented in the article.

**Enhanced Focus and Efficiency:** Keyword highlighting minimizes the cognitive load of searching for specific information. Researchers can focus their reading efforts on highlighted sections, leading to a more efficient information extraction process.

In essence, ARGUS's assisted reading functionalities, particularly keyword highlighting, empower researchers to navigate research articles with greater speed and comprehension. This allows them to dedicate more time to critically analyzing the extracted information and drawing insightful conclusions from their literature review.
