ARGUS: Revolutionizing Research Through Streamlined Literature Reviews
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The cornerstone of scientific progress lies in the ability to effectively synthesize existing knowledge. Systematic reviews play a critical role in this process, offering researchers a comprehensive understanding of research within a specific domain. However, the traditional approach to conducting these reviews is often a laborious and error-prone endeavor. Manually sifting through vast collections of research articles, meticulously extracting relevant information, and synthesizing findings consumes significant research time and resources. This time-intensive process can hinder research progress and limit the depth of analysis.

Introducing ARGUS
-----------------

ARGUS emerges as a software application designed to empower researchers by streamlining the literature review process. It functions as a one-stop solution, offering a suite of functionalities that automate key tasks and enhance information visualization. This user-friendly application aims to revolutionize the way researchers approach literature reviews, allowing them to dedicate more time to critical analysis and discovery.
