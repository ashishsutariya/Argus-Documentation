Future Advancements: Expanding ARGUS's Capabilities
----------------------------------------------------

While ARGUS offers a robust set of functionalities for streamlining literature reviews, its potential for growth is vast. Here, we explore some exciting possibilities for future advancements:

1. Automated Information Extraction
--------------------------------------

Currently, ARGUS excels at guiding researchers towards relevant information within research articles. The next step lies in automating the information extraction process itself. This would involve:

   - **Machine Learning Integration:** Integrating machine learning algorithms like Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) can enable ARGUS to automatically identify and extract key information from research articles. NER can identify entities like authors, institutions, and locations, while NLP can extract details like research methods, findings, and conclusions.

   - **User-Defined Templates:** Researchers could define templates specifying the type of information they require (e.g., study methodology, results tables). ARGUS, equipped with machine learning, would then automatically extract and populate these templates with the relevant data points from the article.

This automation would significantly reduce the time researchers spend manually extracting data, allowing them to focus on analysis and interpretation.

2. Data Visualization
------------------------

Extracted data often holds valuable insights when presented visually. Future versions of ARGUS could integrate data visualization tools:

   - **Interactive Charts and Graphs:** Researchers could generate various charts and graphs (e.g., bar charts, scatter plots) to visualize trends, patterns, and relationships within the extracted data.

   - **Comparative Analysis:** Visualizations could facilitate comparisons between different studies or research groups, allowing researchers to identify emerging trends and potential areas for further investigation.

Enhanced data visualization capabilities would empower researchers to gain deeper understanding from their literature reviews and effectively communicate their findings to others.

3. Database Integration and Document Support
----------------------------------------------

As the user base and data volume grow, considerations for scalability become crucial:

   - **Database Integration:** Currently, ARGUS might utilize a folder-based approach for data storage. To ensure efficient data management and retrieval for larger datasets, migrating to a database solution like MySQL or PostgreSQL would be necessary.

   - **Expanded Document Support:** Currently, ARGUS might primarily focus on PDF documents. To cater to diverse research disciplines, expanding support for other document formats like Word documents or even scholarly websites could be explored.

These advancements would solidify ARGUS's position as a comprehensive solution for streamlining literature reviews, empowering researchers across various fields to conduct more efficient and insightful investigations.
