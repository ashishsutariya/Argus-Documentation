ARGUS is an innovative software application designed to revolutionize the literature review process for researchers across various academic disciplines. By leveraging advanced automation technologies, ARGUS empowers researchers to conduct more efficient, accurate, and comprehensive reviews of existing literature, saving time and effort.

Key Functionalities
----------------------

ARGUS offers a suite of powerful functionalities tailored specifically for academic research:

1. **Document Analysis and Ranking:** ARGUS takes documents or research papers as input from the user and calculates matching scores, such as cosine similarity, of user-specified keywords or terms with all the documents. It then ranks the documents in descending order based on these scores, enabling users to quickly identify the most relevant papers.

2. **Keyword Highlighting and Contextual Analysis:** Users can select a paper from the ranked list, and ARGUS will display the research paper in a dedicated window. ARGUS also provides a checklist of the search terms added by the user. By checking the checkbox next to each term, users can highlight the corresponding word in the document in a unique color. This feature allows users to quickly skim through the document, focus on areas relevant to their research interests, and gain context by examining the highlighted keywords in context.

3. **Frequency Analysis:** ARGUS provides users with the frequency of each word in each document, allowing them to gain insights into the distribution of keywords and terms across the literature. This feature enables users to identify recurring themes, concepts, and topics within the research papers, facilitating a deeper understanding of the literature landscape.

4. **Insights and Trends Identification:** By analyzing the frequency and distribution of keywords across multiple documents, ARGUS enables users to identify emerging trends, recurring themes, and key insights within the literature. This feature helps researchers uncover hidden patterns, connections, and relationships, facilitating the generation of novel research hypotheses and driving innovation within their respective fields.

By combining advanced document analysis, keyword highlighting, frequency analysis, and insights identification functionalities, ARGUS simplifies the literature review process, reduces research efforts, and empowers researchers to uncover valuable insights from the vast corpus of existing literature.
